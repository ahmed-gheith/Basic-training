						Is this the real life?<br>
						Is this just fantasy?<br>
						Caught in a landslide<br>
						No escape from reality<br>
						Open your eyes<br>
						Look up to the skies and see<br>
						I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
						Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
						A little high, little low<br>
						Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter<br> to me, to me

						It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you<br>
						There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do<br>
						I bless the rains down in Africa<br>
						Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (ooh, ooh)<br>

						I'll be coming for your love, okay?<br>
